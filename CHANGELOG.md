# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

## 3.0.2 (2020-10-02)

- fix: Use the traces sample rate for traces instead of the event sample rate (#1106)

## 3.0.1 (2020-10-01)

- fix: Use Span on Scope instead of Transaction for GuzzleMiddleware (#1099)

## 3.0.0 (2020-09-28)

**Tracing API**

In this version we released API for Tracing. `\Sentry\startTransaction` is your entry point for manual instrumentation.
More information can be found in our [Performance](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/performance/) docs.

**Breaking Change**: This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). If you are
using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version `>= v20.6.0` to work. If you are using
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io) nothing will change and no action is needed.
