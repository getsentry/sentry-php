**Tracing API**

In this version we released API for Tracing. `\Sentry\startTransaction` is your entry point for manual instrumentation.
More information can be found in our [Performance](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/performance/) docs.

**Breaking Change**: This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/). If you are
using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version `>= v20.6.0` to work. If you are using
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io) nothing will change and no action is needed.

- [BC BREAK] Remove the `Context::CONTEXT_USER`, `Context::CONTEXT_RUNTIME`, `Context::CONTEXT_TAGS`, `Context::CONTEXT_EXTRA`, `Context::CONTEXT_SERVER_OS` constants (#1047)
- [BC BREAK] Use PSR-17 factories in place of the Httplug's ones and return a promise from the transport (#1066)
- [BC BREAK] The Monolog handler does not set anymore tags and extras on the event object (#1068)
