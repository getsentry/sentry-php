The Sentry PHP error reporter tracks errors and exceptions that happen during the
execution of your application and provides instant notification with detailed
informations needed to prioritize, identify, reproduce and fix each issue. Learn
more about [automatic PHP error reporting with Sentry](https://sentry.io/for/php/).

## Features

- Automatically report (un)handled exceptions and errors
- Send customized diagnostic data
- Process and sanitize data before sending it over the network

## Usage

```php
// Instantiate a new client with a compatible DSN and install built-in
// handlers
$client = (new Raven_Client('http://public@example.com/1'))->install();

// Capture an exception
$event_id = $client->captureException($ex);

// Give the user feedback
echo "Sorry, there was an error!";
echo "Your reference ID is " . $event_id;
```

Contributing
------------

Dependencies are managed through composer:

```
$ composer install
```

Tests can then be run via phpunit:

```
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
```


Tagging a Release
-----------------

1. Make sure ``CHANGES`` is up to date (add the release date) and ``master`` is green.

2. Create a new branch for the minor version (if not present):

```
$ git checkout -b releases/1.11.x
```

3. Update the hardcoded version tag in ``Client.php``:

```php
class Raven_Client
{
    const VERSION = '1.11.0';
}
```

4. Commit the change:

```
$ git commit -a -m "1.11.0"
```

5. Tag the branch:

```
git tag 1.11.0
```

6. Push the tag:

```
git push --tags
```

7. Switch back to ``master``:

```
git checkout master
```

8. Add the next minor release to the ``CHANGES`` file:

```
## 1.12.0 (unreleased)
```

9. Update the version in ``Client.php``:

```php
class Raven_Client
{
    const VERSION = '1.12.x-dev';
}
```

10. Lastly, update the composer version in ``composer.json``:

```json
    "extra": {
        "branch-alias": {
            "dev-master": "1.12.x-dev"
        }
    }
```

All done! Composer will pick up the tag and configuration automatically.
