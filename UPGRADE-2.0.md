### Client

- The constructor of the `Client` class has changed its signature. The only way
  to set the DSN is now to set it in the options passed to the `Configuration`
  class.

  Before:

  ```php
  public function __construct($options_or_dsn = null, $options = array())
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

  After:

  public function __construct(Configuration $config, HttpAsyncClient $httpClient, RequestFactory $requestFactory)
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

- The methods `Client::getRelease` and `Client::setRelease` have been removed.
  You should use `Configuration::getRelease()` and `Configuration::setRelease`
  instead.

  Before:

  $client->setRelease(...);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->getRelease();
  $client->getConfig()->setRelease(...);
  ```

- The methods `Client::getEnvironment` and `Client::setEnvironment` have been
  removed. You should use `Configuration::getCurrentEnvironment` and
  `Configuration::setCurrentEnvironment` instead.

  $client->setEnvironment(...);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->getCurrentEnvironment();
  $client->getConfig()->setCurrentEnvironment(...);
  ```

- The methods `Client::getDefaultPrefixes` and `Client::setPrefixes` have been
  removed. You should use `Configuration::getPrefixes` and `Configuration::setPrefixes`
  instead.

  Before:

  $client->getPrefixes();
  $client->setPrefixes(...);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->getPrefixes();
  $client->getConfig()->setPrefixes(...);
  ```

- The methods `Client::getAppPath` and `Client::setAppPath` have been removed.
  You should use `Configuration::getProjectRoot` and `Configuration::setProjectRoot`
  instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->getAppPath();
  $client->setAppPath(...);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->getProjectRoot();
  $client->getConfig()->setProjectRoot(...);

- The methods `Client::getExcludedAppPaths` and `Client::setExcludedAppPaths`
  have been removed. You should use `Configuration::getExcludedProjectPaths`
  and `Configuration::setExcludedProjectPaths` instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->getExcludedAppPaths();
  $client->setExcludedAppPaths(...);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->getExcludedProjectPaths();
  $client->getConfig()->setExcludedProjectPaths(...);

- The methods `Client::getSendCallback` and `Client::setSendCallback` have been
  removed. You should use `Configuration::shouldCapture` and `Configuration::setShouldCapture`
  instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->getSendCallback();
  $client->setSendCallback(...);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->shouldCapture();
  $client->getConfig()->setShouldCapture(...);

- The method `Client::getServerEndpoint` has been removed. You should use
  `Configuration::getServer` instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->getServerEndpoint();
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getConfig()->getServer();
  ```

- The method `Client::getTransport` has been removed. You should use

  $client->getConfig()->getErrorTypes();
  ```

- The `Client::getDefaultProcessors` method has been removed.

- The `Client::message` method has been removed.

- The `Client::captureQuery` method has been removed.

- The `Client::captureMessage` method has changed its signature by removing the
  `$stack` and `$vars` arguments.

  Before:

  ```php
  public function captureMessage($message, $params = array(), $data = array(), $stack = false, $vars = null)
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  public function captureMessage($message, array $params = [], array $payload = [])
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

- The `Client::captureException` method has changed its signature by removing the
  `$logger` and `$vars` arguments.

  Before:

  ```php
  public function captureException($exception, $data = null, $logger = null, $vars = null)
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  public function captureException($exception, array $payload = [])
  {
      // ...
  }
  ```

- The `$vars` argument of the `Client::captureException`, `Client::captureMessage` and
  `Client::captureQuery` methods accepted some values that were setting additional data
  in the event like the tags or the user data. Some of them have changed name.

  Before:

  ```php
  $vars = array(
      'tags' => array(...),
      'extra' => array(...),
      'user' => array(...),
  );

  $client->captureException(new Exception(), null, null, $vars);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $payload = array(
      'tags_context' => array(...),
      'extra_context' => array(...),
      'user_context' => array(...),
  );

  $client->captureException(new Exception(), $payload);
  ```

- If an exception implemented the `getSeverity()` method its value was used as error
  level of the event. This has been changed so that only the `ErrorException` or its
  derivated classes are considered for this behavior.

- The method `Client::createProcessors` has been removed as there is no need to create
  instances of the processors from outside the `Client` class.

- The method `Client::setProcessors` has been removed. You should use `Client::addProcessor`
  and `Client::removeProcessor` instead to manage the processors that will be executed.

  Before:

  ```php
  $processor1 = new Processor();
  $processor2 = new Processor();

  $client->setProcessors(array($processor2, $processor1));
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $processor1 = new Processor();
  $processor2 = new Processor();

  $client->addProcessor($processor2);
  $client->addProcessor($processor1);

  // or

  $client->addProcessor($processor1);
  $client->addProcessor($processor2, 255); // Note the priority: higher the priority earlier a processor will be executed. This is equivalent to adding first $processor2 and then $processor1
  ```

- The method `Client::process` has been removed as there is no need to process event data
  from outside the `Client` class.

- The `Raven_Processor` class has been removed. There is not anymore a base
  abstract class for the processors, but a `ProcessorInterface` interface has
  been introduced.

- The `Client::user_context` method has been removed. You should use `Client::getUserContext`
  instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->user_context(array('foo' => 'bar'));
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getUserContext()->setData(array('foo' => 'bar'));
  ```

- The `Client::tags_context` method has been removed. You should use `Client::getTagsContext`
  instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->tags_context(array('foo', 'bar'));
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getTagsContext()->setData(array('foo', 'bar'));
  ```

- The `Client::extra_context` method has been removed. You should use `Client::getExtraContext`
  instead.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->extra_context(array('foo' => 'bar'));
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getExtraContext()->setData(array('foo' => 'bar'));
  ```

- The `transaction` property has been made private. You should use `Client::getTransactionStack`
  instead to access the instance of the object.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->transaction->push('foo');
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getTransactionStack()->push('foo');
  ```

### Client builder

- To simplify the creation of a `Client` object instance, a new builder class
  has been added.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client = new Client([...]);
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $httpClient = new HttpClient(); // This can be any Httplug client adapter
  $requestFactory = new RequestFactory(); // This can be any Httplug PSR-7 request factory
  $client = new Client(new Configuration([...], $httpClient, $requestFactory));

  // or

  $client = ClientBuilder::create([...])->getClient();
  ```

### Processors

- The `RemoveCookiesProessor` class has been renamed to `SanitizeCookiesProcessor` to
  better reflect its purpose. The constructor accepts an array of options to make the
  behaviour of which cookies to sanitize configurable.

### Context

- The `Raven_Context` class has been renamed to `Context` and added to the `Raven`
  namespace to follow the PSR-4 convention.

- The `tags`, `extra` and `user` properties of the `Raven_Context` class have
  been removed. Each instance of the new class represents now a single context
  type only and provides some useful methods to interact with the data.

### Transactions

- The method `TransactionStack::push` has changed its signature. It used to accept
  a single value only, but now more values can be passed in a single call.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->transaction->push('foo');
  $client->transaction->push('bar');
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getTransactionStack()->push('foo');
  $client->getTransactionStack()->push('bar');

  // or

  $client->getTransactionStack()->push('foo', 'bar');
  ```

- The method `TransactionStack::pop` has changed its signature by removing the
  `$context` argument. Consequently the behaviour of the method in regards to
  the returned value changed as well: it's not possible anymore to pop all values
  up to one that equals the value of `$context`.

  Before:

  ```php
  $client->transaction->push('foo', 'bar', 'baz');
  
  $value = $client->transaction->pop(); // $value is 'baz'
  $value = $client->transaction->pop('foo'); // $value is 'foo'
  $value = $client->transaction->pop(); // $value is null
  ```

  After:

  ```php
  $client->getTransactionStack()->push('foo', 'bar', 'baz');

  while (!$client->getTransactionStack()->isEmpty()) {
      $value = $client->getTransactionStack()->pop(); // $value is 'baz', then 'bar', then 'foo'
  }

  $value = $client->getTransactionStack()->pop(); // $value is null
  ```
